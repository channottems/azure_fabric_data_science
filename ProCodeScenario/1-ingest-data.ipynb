A Delta Lake table is a data table format that extends Parquet data files with a file-based transaction log for ACID transactions and scalable metadata management."],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"652c150e-e033-49f6-aacc-b1e3a807711d"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Prerequisites\n","\n","- [Add a lakehouse](https://aka.ms/fabric/addlakehouse) to this notebook.
